Quassel Backlog Search - Installation Notes

Please also have a look at README file!

To install simply copy the complete data to a folder reachable via http 
(with php-support) ON THE SERVER where the quasselcore runs.

The php-version must be at least 5.1 and with PostgreSQL Support (pgsql) OR PDO Driver for SQLite 3.x. 

To finish just generate and configure the "config.php" for your system. 
There is a "config.php.sample", read the comments there for help.

Now everything should run. Simply point your browser to the index.php, 
enter your quassel login details and enjoy an easy way to search!

For help, you can contact "m4yer" on FreeNode in #quassel (please via 
query) or per mail <m4yer@minad.de>
